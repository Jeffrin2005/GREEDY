Letâ€™s do a dry run with the example string s = "eccbbbbdec".


lastPosition map: {e: 9, c: 9, b: 6, d: 8}
partitions vector: []
start: 0
end: 0
First Iteration (i = 0):
Character: e
end = max(0, 9) = 9
i is not equal to end, so continue.
Second Iteration (i = 1):
Character: c
end = max(9, 9) = 9
i is not equal to end, so continue.
Third Iteration (i = 2):
Character: c
end = max(9, 9) = 9
i is not equal to end, so continue.
Fourth Iteration (i = 3):
Character: b
end = max(9, 6) = 9
i is not equal to end, so continue.
Fifth Iteration (i = 4):
Character: b
end = max(9, 6) = 9
i is not equal to end, so continue.
Sixth Iteration (i = 5):
Character: b
end = max(9, 6) = 9
i is not equal to end, so continue.
Seventh Iteration (i = 6):
Character: b
end = max(9, 6) = 9
i is not equal to end, so continue.
Eighth Iteration (i = 7):
Character: d
end = max(9, 8) = 9
i is not equal to end, so continue.
Ninth Iteration (i = 8):
Character: e
end = max(9, 9) = 9
i is not equal to end, so continue.
Tenth Iteration (i = 9):
Character: c
end = max(9, 9) = 9
i is equal to end, so:
Add end - start + 1 = 9 - 0 + 1 = 10 to partitions
Update partitions to [10]
Update start to 10
